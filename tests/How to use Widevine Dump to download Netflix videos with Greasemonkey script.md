Greasemonkey is a browser extension that allows you to customize the way websites look and behave by running user scripts. User scripts are small pieces of code that modify the web pages you visit. You can find and install user scripts from various websites, such as [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/) or [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/).
 
One of the user scripts that can help you download Netflix videos is called [Netflix Download](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/372847-netflix-download). This script adds a download button to the Netflix video player, which lets you save the video as an MP4 file. To use this script, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Install Greasemonkey extension on your browser. You can find it [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox and [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome.
2. Install Netflix Download user script from [this link](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/372847-netflix-download).
3. Open Netflix and log in to your account.
4. Select the video you want to download and play it.
5. Click on the download button that appears on the bottom right corner of the video player.
6. Choose a name and location for the MP4 file and click save.
7. Wait for the download to finish and enjoy your offline Netflix video.

Note that this method may not work for all Netflix videos, especially those that are protected by DRM (digital rights management). Also, be aware that downloading Netflix videos may violate their terms of service, so use this script at your own risk.
